# Megaline Plan Revenue Analysis

## Project Overview

This project explores which of two prepaid mobile plans offered by the fictional telecom provider Megaline—Surf or Ultimate—generates more revenue. As an analyst, the task was to conduct an exploratory and revenue-based comparison of both plans using a sample of 500 clients.

## Objectives

- Clean and organize the raw telecom usage data  
- Investigate client behavior across calls, texts, and internet usage  
- Calculate monthly revenue per user and plan  
- Identify which plan is more profitable and support budget recommendations

## Tools & Technologies

- Python  
- pandas, NumPy  
- matplotlib, seaborn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Approach

- Merged multiple datasets including user info, messages, calls, and internet usage  
- Handled missing values and data formatting (e.g., MB to GB conversions)  
- Calculated revenue per user using Megaline’s billing rules  
- Visualized plan usage and revenue trends with descriptive charts  
- Conducted grouped comparisons and statistical summaries

## Key Results

- The Ultimate plan consistently generated more revenue per user despite higher costs  
- Surf users often exceeded their included services, incurring extra charges  
- The analysis supported allocating more advertising budget toward the Ultimate plan
